[12:42:27] Speaker: What would you make there?
[12:42:35] Jimmy: Hey! The VAD is working now — I caught your full sentence instead of cutting it off. How does the audio quality sound on your end?
[12:43:27] Speaker: I oblige as a natural solution to your response, actually good.
[12:43:39] Jimmy: Good to hear! The VAD is working much better now — captured your full six-second utterance. Though Whisper might need an upgrade from base to small for better accuracy.
[12:44:28] Speaker: However, is it an area of narrating urances on tenses because the huge part between one consent and a response?
[12:46:29] Speaker: because you don't say a thing.
[12:50:38] Jimmy: Sorry, I missed those — got distracted by a heartbeat check. Yeah, the transcription accuracy is rough. I am using Whisper base model right now. We could upgrade to small or medium for better results, but it will be slower on the Pi.
